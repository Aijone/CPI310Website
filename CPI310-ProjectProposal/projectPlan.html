               <p> One feature we could add if we have time is have the teachers rate their own classes based on what is the
                   best way they think students can succeed in the class. We could also add another database to discuss and gather information
                   on how teachers teach their class. For example, if the teacher uses powerpoints or if they adopt a more free-lecture style.
                      </p>
                      
                  
               <p> One feature we could remove if we do not have time is the hashtag feature which is also present in the ratemyprofessors website.
                   This feature is helpful to categorize comments and classes by sorting them into hashtags such as #notenoughlectures or #textbookheavy.
                   However, it is not the most vital part of the website, since this information can be read in the comments as well </p>
